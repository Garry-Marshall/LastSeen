```

### Get user information

/whois @username
/whois nickname
```

```
/inactive
```
Shows all members inactive for more than the configured threshold.

### View server activity statistics
```
/server-stats
```
Displays comprehensive server activity metrics including:
- Current online/offline counts
- Activity breakdown by time period (last hour, 24h, 7d, 30d, 30d+)
- Activity percentages and engagement rates
- Visual ASCII chart of activity distribution

### Configure the bot (Admin only)
```
/config
```
Opens an interactive panel with buttons for configuration.

## Features Explained

### Presence Tracking
- When a user goes **offline**, their `last_seen` timestamp is recorded
- When a user comes **online**, `last_seen` is set to 0 (indicating current activity)
- This allows accurate "last seen" tracking while showing online users as "Currently online"

### Activity Statistics
- View comprehensive server activity metrics with `/server-stats`
- See online/offline distribution across different time periods
- Visual ASCII charts showing activity breakdown
- Track engagement rates and recent activity percentages

### Role-Based Visibility
- Optionally configure specific roles to track (via `/config`)
- Only members with designated roles will have their activity monitored
- Useful for tracking specific member groups (e.g., "Verified", "Member")
- Leave empty to track all members (default behavior)

### Channel Restrictions
- Limit bot commands to specific channels for better server organization
- Configure via `/config` with channel names or IDs
- Helps prevent command spam in general chat
- Leave empty to allow commands in all channels (default)

### Multi-Guild Support
- Each guild has its own configuration (notification channel, inactive days, role/channel filters)
- User data is tracked separately per guild
- Same user in multiple guilds = separate records for privacy

### Rejoining Members
- When a user rejoins a guild, their existing record is updated (not duplicated)
- `is_active` flag is set back to 1
- Username, nickname, and roles are refreshed

## Logging

Logs are stored in the `logs/` directory with daily rotation:
- Filename format: `YYYY-MM-DD.log`
- Log levels: debug, info, warning, error
- Configure via `DEBUG_LEVEL` in `.env`

## Troubleshooting

### Bot not responding to commands
- Ensure bot has proper permissions in your server
- Check that slash commands are synced (restart bot to re-sync)
- Verify bot token is correct in `.env`

### Presence tracking not working
- Enable **PRESENCE INTENT** in Discord Developer Portal
- Bot must be in fewer than 100 servers (or be verified)

### Database errors
- Ensure database file has write permissions
- Check logs for specific error messages

### Commands not showing up
- Wait a few minutes for Discord to sync commands globally
- Try kicking and re-inviting the bot

## Privacy & Data

This bot stores:
- User IDs, usernames, nicknames
- Join dates and last seen timestamps
- Role names
- Guild information

All data is stored locally in SQLite database. No data is sent to external services.

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Check the logs in `logs/` directory
- Review the error messages in console
- Ensure all configuration is correct

This is a personal project to keep track of Guild Members in Discord servers.
